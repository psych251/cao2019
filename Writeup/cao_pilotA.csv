We would like to describe the purpose of this study. We are interested in what judgments people make when statistics and morality are both at stake - whether people make the egalitarian or the Bayesian judgment. We would also like to explore the relationship between the type of judgment a person makes and the person's moral evaluation of someone else who makes a Bayesian judgment. We ask that you do not share this information with other potential participants. 
We appreciate your response to the next question. Please be honest when answering. Your answer will not affect your payment or eligibility for future studies.
The study you have just participated in is a psychological study aimed at understanding human cognition and behavior. Psychological research depends on participants like you. Your responses to surveys like this one are an incredibly valuable source of data for researchers. It is therefore crucial for research that participants pay attention, avoid distractions, and take all study tasks seriously (even when they might seem silly).
Do you feel that you paid attention, avoided distractions, and took this survey seriously?",What is your age,What is your gender? - Selected Choice,What is your gender? - Other (please indicate) - Text,What is your highest level of education?,Please leave any feedback or constructive comments about the study in the space below (if any),mTurk
