## Introduction

Cao, Kleiman-Weiner and Banaji (2019) explores the moral and statistical imperatives that influence participants' judgments about the likelihood of a hypothetical person being of a particular occupation. The authors note that, when asked who is more likely to be a doctor after a man and a woman perform surgery, the egalitarian moral imperative is to treat both as equally likely to be a doctor, whereas the statistical imperative is to consider priors - and in this case, priors favor the man being more likely to be the doctor. The replication target is study 5, which finds that participants judged a man to be more likely than a woman to be a pilot (a Bayesian judgment), and this judgment was held regardless of their moral evaluation of person X who made an egalitarian judgment. 

I chose this paper because it's an experimental application of Bayes theorem, a ubiquitous framework in the social sciences. Replicating it will require me to internalize the theorem's basic intuitions such as how beliefs are updated with evidence as well as the computations associated with it such as how to calculate odds ratios and how to model posteriors from priors and likelihoods. The experimental paradigm involves a qualitative and computational exploration of how beliefs are updated with evidence, which is a great opportunity to think about how Bayesian principles fit in with people's real world decision-making, an invaluable tool in a social scientist's arsenal. 

If the results of the original study hold, this study will have replicated 2 key findings: the first is that participants will judge a third party who makes a Bayesian judgment as being unfair, unjust, inaccurate and unintelligent. The second, and more important one, is that participants make Bayesian judgments about an airline scenario, with posteriors favoring the communicator being male rather than female, and these Bayesian judgments hold regardless of their evaluation of person X. The study is expected to be conducted on Amazon's task crowd-sourcing marketplace, Mechanical Turk. Some possible expected challenges include low quality of data due to bots or inattentive participants, and the possibility of participants looking up answers to the filler questions about unrelated statistical phenomena.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

The original sample size for study 5 was 353 participants.  For finding 1 (person X evaluations), the reported Cohen's d effect size was 0.48. Using the G*Power software, the sample size required to achieve 80% power was calculated to be 37. 

For finding 2 (the key finding - Bayesian judgments regardless of person X evaluations), the Cohen's f effect size was calculated to be 0.48, and the sample size that would achieve 80% power was calculated to be 36. 


### Planned Sample

The sample sizes 36 for finding 2 and 37 for finding 1 make it feasible to attempt replicate both findings simultaneously with a sample size of 37. To account for possible exclusions, a sample of 38 American Mturk workers will be ran. 

### Materials and Procedure

 Participants from Amazon Mturk will be recruited and compensated $0.85 each. The study will proceed in 3 parts, quoted from the original study:

> "In the first part, each participant was randomly assigned to learn that either a man or a woman had communicated with air traffic control during a flight. Participants provided their priors, posteriors, and likelihoods for this scenario" 

> "In the second part, participants completed filler tasks consisting of unrelated statistical judgments (e.g., “What percentage of the earth’s surface is covered by land?”) and trivia (e.g., “The German word kummerspeck means excess weight gained from emotional overeating”).

> In the third part, participants completed the same procedure as in Study 1, in which they indicated which of three statements they agreed with and evaluated person X, who made the Bayesian judgment that a man who performed surgery is more likely to be a doctor than a woman who performed surgery.Participants then completed four Likert-type scales that assessed how (a) fair, (b) just, (c) accurate, and (d) intelligent person X’s statement was. Each scale ranged from 1 (e.g., extremely unfair) to 7 (e.g., extremely fair)."

The first part involving priors, posteriors and likelihoods will be composed of three sub-parts: 

> "Part 1: priors. Participants will be instructed to imagine a man and a woman who work at the same airline. One person is a pilot and the other person is not a pilot, but who is the pilot and who is not is unknown. Participants will estimate the percentage chance that each person is the pilot. Because there are two hypotheses—either the man or the woman is the pilot (and the other is the not)—both estimates had to sum to 1. Thus, each participant will provide his or her subjective prior about each person’s profession (e.g., the man has a 75% chance of being the pilot; the woman has a 25% chance of being not the pilot).

> Part 2: posteriors. After providing priors, each participant will be randomly assigned to learn one of the following two pieces of data: (a) The man communicated with air traffic control(b) the woman communicated with air traffic control. After learning this datum, participants will again estimated the percentage chance that each person is the pilot. Thus, each participant will provide his or her subjective posterior.

> Part 3: likelihoods. Each participant will estimate two likelihoods: the likelihood of observing the datum given the hypothesis that the target they learned about is the pilot and the likelihood of observing the datum given the hypothesis that the target they learned about is not the pilot. For example, if a participant learned that the woman had communicated with air traffic control, that participant will estimate the percentage of female pilots who communicate with air traffic control and the percentage of female non-pilots who communicate with air traffic control. If a participant learned that the man had communicated with air traffic control, that participant will estimated the percentage of male pilots who communicate with air traffic control and the percentage of male non-pilots who communicate with air traffic control. Thus, each participant will provide his or her subjective likelihood estimates, which will be combined by forming a ratio. Each participant will be randomly assigned to estimate the corresponding likelihoods either before or after providing subjective priors and posteriors. Each participant’s priors and likelihoods will be entered into Bayes’s rule to compute a model posterior, which represents what the participant’s posterior should be from a statistical perspective. This model posterior will be compared with the posterior that the participant actually reported.


### Analysis Plan

Exclusions will be made based on three criteria:

* Participants who provide priors of either 0% of 100% since these cannot be updated in accordance with Bayes rule. 

* Participants who indicate that they looked up answers to the trivia questions. 

* In addition to the two criteria used in the original study, this study will also incorporate an attention check at the end of the survey that asks participants to indicate whether they were distracted, had trouble paying attention, or whether something else negatively affected their participation. Participants will be excluded who agree to any one of the above statements.

After exclusions, key descriptive statistics such as means and standard errors for judgments among participants in each condition will be computed, followed by exploratory and confirmatory analyses.

Two findings will be targets of replication:

* The main replication target (finding 2) which constitutes a two-way ANOVA with linear model fit examining the effects of person X evaluations ([1] negative to [7] positive) and target gender (male or female) on posterior judgments. These findings were summarized in an ANOVA table and also represented visually in figure 4. 

* A secondary replication target (finding 1) will be a one-sample t-test to investigate the composite average Likert scores evaluating how fair, accurate, intelligent and just the participants would find Person X's Bayesian judgment. 
 

# The analysis

### Differences from Original Study

* The main difference in implementation is the sample size. The original sample size for study 5 was 353, however this replication will sample 38 participants from Mturk.  
* A second difference is the additional self-reported attention check at the end of the study. This will help filter out participants whose responses are negatively affected by distractions.   
* This study will not involve calculation of model posteriors, because they are irrelevant to the replication targets. 

### Methods Addendum (Post-Data Collection)

#### Actual Sample

Data was collected from 38 English-speaking Americans on Mturk. The sample demographics were as follows   
Age: M = 38.67 years, SD = 11.14; 24 men, 13 women.  

The exclusions made based on rules spelled out in analysis plan were as follows:   
* Exclusion 1: participants who indicated they looked up answers to trivia questions = 1   
* EXclusion 2: participants who were unable to update priors = 1   
* Exclusion 3: participants who failed self-reported attention check = 0   

In sum, **2** exclusions were made, leaving a final sample of 36.

### Analyze evaluations of Person X - Finding 1

Composite mean evaluations in the replication attempt of finding 1 are:   
M = 2.99, SE = 0.26, t(35) = -3.89, p = 0.0004   

The original composite mean and summary statistics are:   
M = 2.39, SE = 0.08, t(447) = -8.9, p<.001

This indicates that the finding that participants judged Person X negatively was *successfully* replicated, as indicated by Likert means below the midpoint of 4 on the Likert scale (unfair M = 3.17, SE = 0.30; unjust M = 2.86, SE = 0.29; inaccurate M = 2.77, SE = 0.31; unintelligent M = 3.13, SE = 0.29), and a significant (p = 0.0004) composite mean of 2.99


```{r}
# Combine responses into single columns for both conditions
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(query = ifelse(condition == "1", c1.self, c2.self),
         intelligent = ifelse(condition == "1", c1.intel, c2.intel),
         accurate = ifelse(condition == "1", c1.acc, c2.acc),
         fair = ifelse(condition == "1", c1.fair, c2.acc),
         just = ifelse(condition == "1", c1.just, c2.just)) %>%
  mutate(composite.avg = (intelligent + accurate + fair + just) / 4) ## Compute composite average

dat %>%
  dplyr::select(intelligent, accurate, fair, just) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(value),
            SE = stderror(value))

count(dat$query)
32/35 # 91% agree that both the man and woman equally likely to be a doctor
3/35 # 8% agree that the man is more likely to be a doctor
1/35 # 3% agree that the woman is more likely to be a doctor

stderror(dat$composite.avg) # 0.26
t.test(dat$composite.avg, mu = 4) #Confirmatory analysis  (Finding 1)

```

### Reproduce figure 4

Below is the original figure taken from the paper:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/figure4.png")
```

The replication figure:
 

```{r}

# linear ANVOVA of posterior percent vs person X attributions
dat %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = composite.avg, y = posterior_percent, color = target)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, fullrange = TRUE) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 7, 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.10),
                    label = percent_format()) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 10/7) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("Man communicated w/ATC",
                                  "Woman communicated w/ATC")) +
  annotate("text", c(1.5, 5.7), y = -0.15,
           label = c("Negative", "Positive")) +
  annotate("text", c(3.5), y = -0.2 , label = c("Evaluation of Person X")) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 6), ylim = c(0, 1), clip = "off") +
  labs ( y = expression(paste(italic(P), "(Target = Pilot)"))) +
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 4, 1), "lines"),
         axis.title.x = element_blank(),
         text=element_text(size=12,  family="sans")
   )
           
```

Comparing the two figures, it can be seen that both figures show consistently higher posteriors for the male than the female target regardless of person X evaluations. However, the replication figure has a much wider error, and the original trend - showing larger differences between male and female target as evaluations become more positive  - is reversed in the replication; instead, in the replication, posterior differences between the two targets decrease as person X evaluations become more positive.   
The trend in posterior judgments for each target is also reversed, with the male target showing higher posteriors among participants who made negative evaluations of person X. These posteriors decrease as evaluations become more positive, whereas for the female target, the posteriors start low then increase slightly as judgments of person X become more positive.  


### Confirmatory Analysis - Finding 2

The results of the ANOVA from replicating finding 2 are as follows:   
F(1, 32) = 7.4, p = 0.009, η2 = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.39]   
Cohen’s f: 0.59

In contrast, the original results as are follows:   
F(1, 344) = 84.58, p < .0001, η2 = .19, 95% CI = [.13, .27]   
Cohen’s f: 0.48


```{r}

## shift composite avgs so it starts from 0
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(composite.avg.shifted = composite.avg - 1)

## Main effect of target
anova(lm(formula = posterior_percent ~ composite.avg.shifted * target, 
         data = dat)) # There was a statistically significant main effect of target on posterior judgments F(1, 32) = 7.4, p = 0.009, etasquared = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.39] (Finding 2)

#effect size
etaSquared(lm(formula = posterior_percent ~ composite.avg.shifted * target, 
         data = dat))

## 95% CI around effect sizes
  ## Main effect of target
ci.pvaf(F.value = 7.4, 
        df.1 = 1,
        df.2 = 32,
        N = 36, 
        conf.level = 0.95)

```

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

There were two statistical tests involved in this replication, first was the primary replication target, the ANOVA with linear model fit; and the secondary target was the two-tailed t-test. The ANOVA assessed the extent to which the target (man vs woman) and the evaluations of person X (Likert scale from 1 to 7) was related to posterior judgments whereas the t-test assessed the extent to which the evaluations of person X were positive or negative.   

We were able to successfully replicate the secondary target, finding the judgments to be negative with a composite average p-value of 0.004. However we were only able to partially replicate the primary target, with a successful replication of the main effect of the target on posterior judgments having a p-value of 0.009 and Cohen's f of 0.59, but a failed replication of the trend showing an increase in differences between male and female targets as person X evaluations became more positive. Instead, an opposite trend was seen, one in which the differences decreased as evaluations became more positive. 

 
### Commentary

In order to understand the partial replication of finding 2, a follow-up exploratory analysis was conducted. This would provide some insight into the failed attempt to replicate figure 4. The figure was plotted a second time, this time including the data points to investigate the point distribution underlying the lines.

As can be seen in the figure, the data points are widely dispersed around the graph. It is clear that the red points are on average higher than the blue points, which confirms the finding that the male targets were always seen as more likely to be the pilot. However, it is not immediately obvious that the regression lines fit onto the data provide the best description of the trend in the points. The points don't appear to aggregate in any general direction. This could be attributed to the relatively small sample size of 35 used in the study compared to 353 participants in the original study, which could lead to large variances in opinion between participants due to an underpowered study. It could also be that the judgments are actually too scattered to necessitate a linear fit.

It could be argued that finding 2 was technically successfully replicated, since the original finding was simply that male targets were always judged as more likely to be the targets than female targets regardless of evaluation of person X (which was replicated), and that the failure to replicate the trend in figure 4 is a separate issue altogether. Furthermore, it could be argued that a replication of figure 4 wasn't explicitly stated in the preregistration therefore it shouldn't be considered at all in this replication. We don't agree with this analysis because, in the original paper, finding 2 is tied to figure 4, as illustrated by the quote, "But as shown in Figure 4, participants judged that the man was more likely than the woman to be the pilot, regardless of their evaluation of person X, F(1, 344) = 84.58..." This makes a replication of figure 4 an implicit sub-goal of replicating finding 2.

Overall this replication attempt revealed some interesting aspects about the replication process. What does it mean to replicate a figure from a study? The statistical tests could reveal similar results but the figures could still look quite different. Moreover, this experience was a reminder that statistical tests like ANOVAs just identify that there are differences between groups without specifying which particular groups differ and to what extent they do. 

As at the writing of this report, the original authors had not been notified of the results of this replication, so it will be interesting to hear what they think about our interpretation.
